# Project2

Data set considered for analysis
https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays

Loaded the data set into Pandas dataframe
Calculated the length of each play in the dataset using as per the number of Lines in each play

Using the analysis noted that 'Hamlet' is the longest play with 4244 lines and 'A Comedy of Errors' is the smallest play 2055 lines
Plotted the plays as per their lengths in ascending order using scatter plot

Shakesphere plays are divided into three categories- History, Tragedy and Comedy
On analysing samples of plays belonging to each of these three categories:
1. Noted that plays falling into the category 'comedy' are the shortest with an average of about 2700 lines per play
2. Historical plays have an average length of about '3200' lines
3. Plays falling into the category of 'Tragedy' have an average length of '3300' lines per play and hence are the longest plays
